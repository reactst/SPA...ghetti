Liar!
ALFRED LANNING LIT HIS CIGAR CAREFULLY, BUT the tips of his fingers were trembling slightly. His
gray eyebrows hunched low as he spoke between puffs.
�It reads minds all right-damn little doubt about that! But why?� He looked at Mathematician Peter
Bogert, �Well?�
Bogert flattened his black hair down with both hands, �That was the thirty-fourth RB model we�ve
turned out, Lanning. All the others were strictly orthodox.�
The third man at the table frowned. Milton Ashe was the youngest officer of U. S. Robot &
Mechanical Men, Inc., and proud of his post.
�Listen, Bogert. There wasn�t a hitch in the assembly from start to finish. I guarantee that.�
Bogert�s thick lips spread in a patronizing smile, �Do you? If you can answer for the entire
assembly line, I recommend your promotion. By exact count, there are seventy-five thousand, two
hundred and thirty-four operations necessary for the manufacture of a single positronic brain, each
separate operation depending for successful completion upon any number of factors, from five to a
hundred and five. If any one of them goes seriously wrong, the �brain� is ruined. I quote our own
information folder, Ashe.�
Milton Ashe flushed, but a fourth voice cut off his reply.
�If we�re going to start by trying to fix the blame on one another, I�m leaving.� Susan Calvin�s
hands were folded tightly in her lap, and the little lines about her thin, pale lips deepened, �We�ve
got a mind-reading robot on our hands and it strikes me as rather important that we find out just
why it reads minds. We�re not going to do that by saying, �Your fault! My fault!� �
Her cold gray eyes fastened upon Ashe, and he grinned.
Lanning grinned too, and, as always at such times, his long white hair and shrewd little eyes made
him the picture of a biblical patriarch, �True for you, Dr. Calvin.�
His voice became suddenly crisp, �Here�s everything in pill-concentrate form. We�ve produced a
positronic brain of supposedly ordinary vintage that�s got the remarkable property of being able to
tune in on thought waves. It would mark the most important advance in robotics in decades, if we
knew how it happened. We don�t, and we have to find out. Is that clear?�
�May I make a suggestion?� asked Bogert.
�Go ahead!�
�I�d say that until we do figure out the mess � and as a mathematician I expect it to be a very devil
of a mess � we keep the existence of RD-34 a secret. I mean even from the other members of the
staff. As heads of the departments, we ought not to find it an insoluble problem, and the fewer
know about it��
�Bogert is right,� said Dr. Calvin. �Ever since the Interplanetary Code was modified to allow robot
models to be tested in the plants before being shipped out to space, antirobot propaganda has
increased. If any word leaks out about a robot being able to read minds before we can announce
complete control of the phenomenon, pretty effective capital could be made out of it.�

Lanning sucked at his cigar and nodded gravely. He turned to Ashe; �I think you said you were
alone when you first stumbled on this thought-reading business.�
�I�ll say I was alone � I got the scare of my life. RB-34 had just been taken off the assembly table
and they sent him down to me. Obermann was off somewheres, so I took him down to the testing
rooms myself � at least I started to take him down.� Ashe paused, and a tiny smile tugged at his
lips, �Say, did any of you ever carry on a thought conversation without knowing it?�
No one bothered to answer, and he continued, �You don�t realize it at first, you know. He just
spoke to me � as logically and sensibly as you can imagine � and it was only when I was most of
the way down to the testing rooms that I realized that I hadn�t said anything. Sure, I thought lots,
but that isn�t the same thing, is it? I locked that thing up and ran for Lanning. Having it walking
beside me, calmly peering into my thoughts and picking and choosing among them gave me the
willies.�
�I imagine it would,� said Susan Calvin thoughtfully. Her eyes fixed themselves upon Ashe in an
oddly intent manner. �We are so accustomed to considering our own thoughts private.�
Lanning broke in impatiently, �Then only the four of us know. All right! We�ve got to go about this
systematically. Ashe, I want you to check over the assembly line from beginning to end �
everything. You�re to eliminate all operations in which there was no possible chance of an error,
and list all those where there were, together with its nature and possible magnitude.�
�Tall order,� grunted Ashe.
�Naturally! Of course, you�re to put the men under you to work on this � every single one if you
have to, and I don�t care if we go behind schedule, either. But they�re not to know why, you
understand.�
�Hm-m-m, yes!� The young technician grinned wryly. �It�s still a lulu of a job.�
Lanning swiveled about in his chair and faced Calvin, �You�ll have to tackle the job from the other
direction. You�re the robo-psychologist of the plant, so you�re to study the robot itself and work
backward. Try to find out how he ticks. See what else is tied up with his telepathic powers, how far
they extend, how they warp his outlook, and just exactly what harm it has done to his ordinary RB
properties. You�ve got that?�
Lanning didn�t wait for Dr. Calvin to answer.
�I�ll co-ordinate the work and interpret the findings mathematically.� He puffed violently at his
cigar and mumbled the rest through the smoke; �Bogert will help me there, of course.�
Bogert polished the nails of one pudgy hand with the other and said blandly, �I dare say. I know a
little in the line.�
�Well! I�ll get started.� Ashe shoved his chair back and rose. His pleasantly youthful face crinkled
in a grin, �I�ve got the darnedest job of any of us, so I�m getting out of here and to work.�
He left with a slurred, �B� seein� ye!�
Susan Calvin answered with a barely perceptible nod, but her eyes followed him out of sight and
she did not answer when Lanning grunted and said, �Do you want to go up and see RB-34 now, Dr.
Calvin?�
