ALFRED LANNING LIT HIS CIGAR CAREFULLY, BUT the tips of his fingers were trembling slightly. His
gray eyebrows hunched low as he spoke between puffs.
�It reads minds all right-damn little doubt about that! But why?� He looked at Mathematician Peter
Bogert, �Well?�
Bogert flattened his black hair down with both hands, �That was the thirty-fourth RB model we�ve
turned out, Lanning. All the others were strictly orthodox.�
The third man at the table frowned. Milton Ashe was the youngest officer of U. S. Robot &
Mechanical Men, Inc., and proud of his post.
